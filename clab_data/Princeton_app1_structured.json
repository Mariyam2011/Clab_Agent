        "personal_statement": "Za-har?-mun (She-dreamed) \nZa-har?-yam (He-dreamed) \n\nSame longing — different futures — determined by the weight of gendered grammar. In my village dreams are verbs only men can conjugate. A girl’s aspirations are tethered to the confines of the kitchen, our ambition as disposable as the onion skins we peel. But, you see, dreams have a peculiar resilience: they persist, even when silenced, and my Amma’s (mother) silence taught me to listen closely…. \n\nAmidst evenings filled with stitching and cooking, I sensed her yearning for what she was denied: education, freedom, autonomy. Hers was a world of nailah-jabir? (unjust necessity), where even the act of learning English marked one as ghair (foreign), kafir (infidel). When I declared my interest in studying Aramaic and Hebrew, the murmurs turned to outrage. “This is be-deen (against the faith),” they said. My love for languages was painted as a betrayal of my identity, a refusal against norms that kept women tethered to what was deemed “acceptable.” \n\nBut my father shielded me from these accusations. He witnessed my care for the books I found in Sunday thrift markets, and the clay piggy bank which I emptied monthly to purchase a new research paper. He knew — I meant no harm — I only wanted knowledge, a right, my right; as important for me as it is for a man. Together, my parents became my refuge, insisting that I could be za-har?-mun-da-hawa-yam (she-dreamed-of-flight). \n\nZa-parh?-mun (She-read) \nZa-parh?-yam (He-read) \n\nIn learning languages — English, Aramaic, and later Persian and Hebrew — I discovered a medium of resistance.  \n\nAramic: “Let no one be lost to time,” a reminder of my mother’s sacrifices.  \n\nHebrew: “The world stands on three things: truth, justice, and peace,” gave me a framework for my advocacy. \n\nPersian: “A stone may stay in water for a long time, but it remains unsoaked,” mirrored the endurance I sought to embody.  \n\nZa-da-lafz-ghair-yam (She-spoke-the-foreign) \n\nWith Global Sisterhood Network (GSN), I formed a multilingual team advocating for women’s rights across 13 languages, connecting over 1,000 women — from Pakistan to Egypt. Language was my weapon, but it was also my salve. I trained volunteers to translate resources, guiding women to learn about their rights in legal systems that often ignored their dialects. \n\nIn one case, I worked with a woman from a Punjabi village whose story of domestic violence had been dismissed by authorities because she couldn’t communicate in Urdu. With the support of Global Sisterhood Network, her voice finally carried the weight it deserved, and her husband faced legal consequences. \n\nZa-difa?-mun (She-defended) \nZa-difa?-yam (He-defended) \n\nSame resistance — different recognition. Advocacy is often an act of unlearning before it becomes action. My linguistic excavations showed me that systemic inequality is not just a policy failure but a failure to listen. Words like lakir (boundary) and baradari (kinship) had been weaponized in my village to confine women. At GSN, we showed that a boundary can be a line of protection, and kinship can extend to sisterhood. \n\nZa-da-hawa-sang?n-yam (I-flew-through-storms) \n\nThrough GSN, I began to see that language as a framework for existence. My advocacy is a verb, a dream I will dare to conjugate no matter if I am not a man; for it is one conjugated in every dialect spoken by the women I’ve worked with. \n\nAs I sit with women in remote villages, helping them draft legal documents in Punjabi or translate their rights into Arabic, I think back to Amma. Her silence was not consent; it was survival. Every word I speak, every sentence I translate, is a continuation of the flight she once dreamed of but could not take. Language is my lens, my mirror, and my weapon, but most of all, it is my possibility — my way to create a world where no woman’s story is lost in translation.",

Combining my interest in Classics and Gender Studies, specifically through CLA 329 - Sex and Gender in Antiquity and GSS 420 - Feminist Theory, I will explore how language and power have historically intertwined.

Having founded Global Sisterhood Network, where we translated legal resources into 13 languages for women, I’ve witnessed the urgent need for linguistic equity.\n\nPrinceton's interdisciplinary ethos—where linguistics can converge with AI, classics, and gender theory—is ideal for a student like me who sees language not merely as communication, but as resistance, preservation, and empowerment.",

Hundreds of cases of acid attacks are reported annually in Pakistan, but most go unacknowledged, buried under the weight of “izzat” (family honor). In our linguistic prison, whispers spread faster than her scars healed: “Girls shouldn’t provoke men.” \n\nFor months, I lived with a choking fear. I avoided mirrors, worried that I might one day reflect Sadaf’s fate. Words that were supposed to \"protect\" me —“chup” (silence), “modesty”, “obedience”—became iron bars. But words cut both ways.  \n\nIn my isolation, I stumbled across stories of survival: Rukhsana, who rebuilt her life after an acid attack by opening her own clothing business; the work of Dr. Fouzia Saeed, whose advocacy redefined workplace harassment laws; Ayesha Siddiqa’s Military Inc., which dissected power structures with unapologetic precision. These were revolutions written by women who refused to be erased. \n\nAnd then, I met Sadaf again, whose words have stayed with me ever since. \n\n\"Don’t pity me,\" Her courage to live had been forged in pain, and in the face of such power I refused to stay in fear. \n\nFor Sadaf’s courage – for mine, and the countless women who live in fear this system sows, I founded Faces of Courage, my declaration that we as women would no longer hide. With a team of eight, we taught 50 survivors vocational and creative skills, organized mental health workshops, and secured six jobs through partnerships with NGOs. But the work was more than numbers. It was in the hands of women stitching embroidery for the first time, their fingers hesitant but determined. It was in the laughter of a survivor learning to paint, reclaiming the brush that her attacker thought he’d stolen forever. \n\nThe opposition was relentless. “Why teach them skills?” “Why give them jobs?” Acid attack survivors, to many, are unworthy of a second chance, relegated to lives hidden in shame. I was accused of disrupting the “natural order,” of tarnishing my family’s name by speaking out. But if speaking against power is a sin, I’ve learned to wear it as a badge of honor. \n\nAt first, my voice trembled; now it resounds. I burn with courage, as does every woman who has walked through the doors of Faces of Courage. Sadaf taught me that words can imprison, but they can also ignite. “Hope,” “resistance”—these are the words we now live by. \n\nI see a world where women are no longer confined by language but freed by it; a narrative I rewrite every day.",

Among classmates and competitions I’ve attended across Pakistan, no one has heard of my language, let alone speaks it. For my grandparents, who learned Urdu and Punjabi as adults to integrate into wider society, Burushaski is their soul — a living archive of which we are the museums.  \n\nLanguage preservation wasn’t always my calling. That began with Ashraf, the local bookseller who handed me a copy of The Lightning Thief: my foray into Greek mythology. That one book cascaded into a love for the languages and histories, but alongside my awe came the heartbreak of realizing they were gone.  \n\nTheir decline mirrored Burushaski, and that realization lit a fire in me to act before my language, too, became a relic. I began small: creating a three-dialect dictionary with my school’s language society and uploading it to a website I designed. To draw attention to the language’s precarious state, I designed apparel printed with Burushaski phrases — turning an endangered tongue into a conversation starter.  \n\nBut I knew I couldn’t stop there. My research project on decoding Egyptian hieroglyphs using machine-learning showed me the vast potential of technology in preserving dying languages. Now, I dream of developing computational tools to analyze linguistic structures and create digital-archives for endangered languages like Burushaski.  \n\nMy language is my identity and I hope to take these efforts global, ensuring no language is lost to silence.",

Her core identity—as a computational linguist leveraging AI to preserve endangered languages and fight for women’s rights—permeates every layer of her application. Unlike generic 'well-rounded' profiles, Aaima demonstrates a spike in a rare and intersectional field: feminist computational linguistics. From decoding Egyptian hieroglyphs using machine learning to founding the Global Sisterhood Network across 13 languages, her work is deeply original, community-centered, and scalable. The intellectual maturity shown in her independent research papers rivals that of college juniors. Her essays exemplify Ethan Sawyer’s principles—specificity, transformation, and vulnerability—especially through metaphoric prose and code-switching that demonstrate emotional and linguistic fluency. As admissions officers, we look for students who will not only thrive in academic settings but also transform campus culture. Aaima fits the Princeton mold of service-oriented scholarship, the Stanford maker mindset, and MIT’s hands-on approach to impact. Her lived experience as a Pakistani girl navigating linguistic boundaries and systemic patriarchy gives her a distinct lens on global equity, which she translates into real-world solutions—from trilingual dictionaries to legal aid for rural women. She is not a student who fits the mold. She redefines it. This is the kind of application that excites a committee not just for what the student has done—but for what she will build next. She is the future of the liberal arts in the age of algorithms."
