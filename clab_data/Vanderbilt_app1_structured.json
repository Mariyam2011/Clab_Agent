        "personal_statement": "My Lord proclaims: \"Do not mix the truth with falsehood,or conceal the truth while you know it.\"- Qur'an Surah Al-Baqarah 2:42 And yet,my maulana's (Islamic teacher)-my teacher's-hands,that should have risen to preach and educate,reached out to me in a vice-like group of violation - perversion coloring his mask of piety. I found myself trapped - in the darkness that lurked within the walls of my madrassas (Islamic school). I came here to understand love for God, - My Creator, my Solace - and yet, here the message of Islam was twisted into malice. I was a child of age 11, and so I remained in the dark that the holiest of men could harbor the most sacrilegious of thoughts - corrupting all in their path. My maulana’s words were laden with false righteousness. I read of accountability, he spoke of extremism,I read of acceptance and he spoke of war. Throughout - the onslaught on my body continued but what could I do? I was Punjabi, my family valued men who embodied strength. To admit I was a victim - to admit I had been prey to the one I was supposed to learn from - would be to betray my masculinity. And thus, I kept silent, my religion and education becoming a prison. Debilitated and desecrated I felt like the madrassa I went to -my body akin to the place of religion that had become a perpetrator of sin. In the anonymity of the screen,I tried - to reach out - to understand: why me? Why my faith? Why my teacher? To my horror, or to my solace - I do not know - hundreds answered - and from behind the screen we learned; Hindu, Baha’i, Christian - each bore the weight of a religion distorted by those who claimed to protect it. From them, I learned that this was not just an Islamic tragedy;it was a human one. My temple was desecrated. My pastor speaks of hellfire instead of love. My priest has turned my sanctuary into a chamber of sin My maulana has violated my creed with the Creator The corruption was universal - and it became clear to me that this, this abhorrence - it was about power, about fear and ignorance - as weapons to subjugate us: the vulnerable. And so,the seeds of revolution planted in my heart took root in the northern reaches of Pakistan. Here, the Baltis and Hazaras, people of deep faith, are bound by chains of neglect. Their madrassas are breeding grounds for extremism,they distort the faith that should uplift them. Yet, in the eyes of the children who sat before me, I saw a flicker of light waiting to be kindled. They did not need indoctrination; they needed education - true education. And so, I began to gather students - those whose faith was not blind but questioning. Together, we built a new kind of classroom, one where Science, Math, and English walked hand in hand with Religion. The scholars I brought to teach were not like the maulanas I had known;they were men and women of integrity, who saw religion as a path to knowledge, not a tool for domination.We spoke of morality, of justice, of compassion and slowly, the numbers grew.Six turned to twenty and twenty turned to seventy, and with them, my students, came a ripple of change.They were learning to think, to question, to understand.They were learning that faith could be a force for good, not for harm. But the road is long.The madrassas still stand, their influence still strong.Yet, we are not afraid.We know now that the truth, once uncovered, cannot be hidden again.The students I teach will carry this revolution forward, not with violence or hatred, but with knowledge and compassion. And perhaps, one day, they will turn to those same madrassas and bring with them the light that was denied to us.",

            "response": "\"vaddan da hosla kar\" Vanderbilt’s motto, in my native language Saraiki, is thus illuminated above. My motivation for translating it stems from how I’ve often lamented the gross under-representation of my language within Pakistan’s educational institutions. Be it public schools swearing by the single national curriculum or private schools embracing international assessment standards, Saraiki remains almost unfounded. It is this language that was my crux - when leaving behind my tribe for city life - in search for better schooling; this language, particularly its music, folktales, and historical scriptures - were what helped me find shelter and refuge. Akin to the theorisations of decolonial thinkers like Sir Ali Meghji and Sir Homi K. Bhabha, it was an immersion with my indigeneity that allowed me to navigate the cultural clash - and thus grow in the foreignness of urbanisation. On a perceptual level, I now conform to the belief system that all students - whether or not they are migrants, like me - must benefit from the plurality of their course syllabi. An emphasis on diverse, inclusive, and representative curriculums is of foremost priority. Contrary to mere theoretical ideation, I saw how my ideological growth catalysed purpose: authoring the Saraiki Declamation, alongside professors and seniors affiliated with “University of the Punjab, Lahore,” I marvelled at our progress. The Punjab High Court is currently reviewing our appeal for students in Punjab’s public schools to be allowed the liberty to study at least one indigenous language, including my beloved, Saraiki. My campaigning does not conclude here. Bringing it to Vanderbilt, I am fascinated by the prospect of establishing a purpose-built student club devoting to education endeavours - inside and outside of campus. This would mark a historic event in the university’s auspicious history - and would be contingent upon me submitting an extensive pitch before the Office of Student Organizations. Here, I would champion the notion of diversifying curriculums - doing justice to the nativity of not just Saraiki speakers, like myself, but a plethora of linguists. Alas, if we are to grow, it is imperative to grow - without our roots and history surfacing as opportunity costs. If we are to grow, we must not forget where we herald from or the background that helps us cope with our existence. \"vaddan da hosla kar\"",

Yahya presents a compelling spike in linguistic and educational justice, deeply rooted in his Saraiki-Punjabi identity and executed through multi-tiered leadership—radio broadcasting, NGO work, peer teaching, and policy advocacy. His essay articulates transformative personal growth from trauma and religious abuse into a life mission centered on reimagining education as a tool of liberation rather than indoctrination. This is exactly the kind of story that elite institutions like Vanderbilt seek: grounded in specificity, propelled by action, and elevated by intellectual engagement. Yahya doesn’t just want to attend Vanderbilt—he wants to transform it by founding cultural initiatives and shaping curriculum conversations. The admission committee likely saw in him not just a strong student, but a future campus change-maker."
