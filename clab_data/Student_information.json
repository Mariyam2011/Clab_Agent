            "Response": "We all are  originally from hafizabad commonly known as the city of rice .In this city among multiple villages resides a similar unimpressive yet my hometown (kasise). We are kharal and rai by our cast a sub division of the rajpoot clan and are related to the hero of war of independence Rai Ahmad khan kharal shaheed . We are proud punjabians are rich cultural background has shaped me alot from listening from my grandmother about our (munshi) a sort of punjabi accountant I guess a sikh known as lal charan and how harmonically we lived and shared the bonds and cherished the moments together. Henceforth by all means I am not the slightest of ashamed of my punjabi identity. However crime and law is something we feel sensitive to talk about as in this area people build law themselves from disputes arising from the draining of water to bloodshed and unjustice resides here which is really common in these monsoon days ."

            "Question": "Discuss the role of religion or spirituality in your life. How have your beliefs influenced your values, actions, and perspective on the world?",
            "Response": "To be very fair my family is not that sort of a really spiritual family people happily living with people of different religions as always have to compromise and eventually they end up being termed as non practicing Muslims. People living with Sikhs,who perhaps dont think wine as haram shaped this ideology in my forefathers and gradually their descendants were not stringent about rules which happened in my life . I a non practicing Muslim wasn't really forced to my religious obligations but eventually among my family members I believe my father was the most educated and it is something which separates his thoughts from the rest who knows what's right thought me right his passion in urdu was instilled in me .People here learn religion from people termed as religious I explored my ways i learned it from the book itself perhaps that's why me and my mom sorry some corrections me and my father have to debate the world with this. As a result I dont hold those people high who follow blindly and think very high of themselves ."

            "Question": "What are the core beliefs and values that guide your decisions and actions? These could stem from religion, philosophy, or personal convictions developed over time.",
            "Response": "My religion ,my parents, my brother and my willpower are the factors which govern my life .To be fair there is an unusual belief that I hold very high or is something I ve learned over thr course of my life that a person who acts as being very religious or has some trait or skill in abundant is the one who actually lacks it because the one who actually owns it has no reason to prove or demonstrate. If talent is not recognized than talent is lost talent is not build its given and by repeated some course of action doesn't really fit u in it"

            "Response": "In all rural areas is a concept which  i believe is far distant from humanity from harassment molesting children at a young age involving them in sexual activities or giving them drugs was  very common.  Consistent Harassment and   abuse is something I ve observed from a very close glance .Feeling uncomfortable sharing this to from dying to share this was never really a big thing but fortunately when u have an older  brother there is less you have to worry about same was the case with me . The closest of my friends is me myself and my brother and what I have learned is brotherhood. The pressure builds up within a body and until it has to explode but i hope I explode from joy not misery ."

            "Question": "What are you passionate about outside of the standard academic and extracurricular activities? Describe any unique hobbies or interests that reveal something deeper about your personality and values.",
            "Response": "What a pleasant stroke a stroke of brush on the canvas but the artist is  virat kohli and the canvas i hope is gaddafi stadium . Sports really is close to my heart or a part of it from Ronaldo back to old Trafford to Roger Federer as the ever best . This all made me think of myself as the ideal sportsmen practicing my bowling action at the weirdest of place perhaps a wedding stage medical store passion sportsmanship has to boundaries. Apart from it I believe in the world of Urdu literature I can be seen as submerged in the fictional real of peere kamil  , amarbail ( urdu novels) from seeing the world from another view.  Thought villains as unhuman creatures to broken heroes things really change with another stroke on the canvas of life."

            "Question": "Looking ahead, what are your aspirations for your college years and beyond? How do your experiences, interests, and values inform your goals?",
            "Response": "Since childhood I ve thought of college as mines how gold is plucked from useless to stored in extravagant and fragile bodies . I hope it makes me what I want a mature man who wants his parents to be happy not the boy who wants his parents to make him happy .I life which has meaning a major which makes me feel pleasure as if I enjoy every moment of it not that I die practicing the basics which the society thinks is the best . I want to enjoy my profession live it like my free time so that I dont have to think of escaping it for breaks and freedom .I profession which is my freedom a skill which makes me feel as if I am a free wanderer. And above a life which fulfills my parents’ dreams. "

            "Response": "I dream what i want in reality not that I dream it cause I can't achieve it .I have a clear goal in mind I have my boundaries clear upfront I dont need anyone to dictate me or tell me my rules are ways to live . I live so that I am not a burden I believe to be the slightest of burden since childhood I used to spend alot of my parents’ money but as soon as I realized I distanced myself from that habit. I asked Less If I ever wanted something I got it for myself with my own couple of bucks a small-scale agro based business as a blessing from my grandmother. Education for me is just another way of removing that burden or feeling of unrest from my parents .Therefore I dont look for something that is free of cost i search for something that is free to my parents and this lifestyle i dream of is just the life where my parents can do what they please no constraint and if there is I ll make sure to deal with it."

            "Question": "Identify key experiences that have fundamentally shaped you. How have these moments informed your character, values, and aspirations?",
            "Response": "Since childhood the quarrels between my PARENTS caused by a random nobody wasn't just the part of the things that affected me the most, ever-growing familial turmoil was the worst.  The tradition of engagement assumed as a word given to God being transformed into just a game for power and money from seeing relation becoming distorted in blink of eye from people exploring each other for their own good brotherhood being questioned on the time of division of ancestral land .That hatred and jealousy for each other is what gave me a view of the real world. I saw how lonely my parents were in these disputes how amazed were they when one of there by blood cousin rebelled just for the sake of some land . It was just the the fancy trailer of the horrific crimes of my family.  And I was the only spectator."
