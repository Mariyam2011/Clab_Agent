        "personal_statement": "Allow me to use this space to introduce you to my Books for they are, in essence, the one symbol, \nthe one creation that I have, almost always, identified with. I read books to escape the grim reality \nof life, and oftentimes find it adding meaning and purpose to my life, connecting me with my inner \nself. My books are like “intersectionality” to Kimberley Crenshaw or “gender performativity” to \nJudith Butler or “hegemonic masculinity” to Raewyn Connell. So, without delay, allow me to \nintroduce you to my books… \n \nHeer Ranjha by Waris Shah,  \n \nMirza Sahiban by Pilu,  \n \nSassi Punnu by Hashim.  \n \nEach of these books are heirlooms of Punjabi folklore, treasured by young readers for their moral \nteachings. It was only natural for me to read these stories because it was my native language in \nJhang, but more importantly, this was the only language my mother comprehended. My beautiful \nAmma Jan, wronged by conservative cultural norms, was divorced from attaining an education.  \n \nOvertime, this created a gap between us. It was, however, Punjabi children’s stories that \nstrengthened our bond and brought my mother out of isolation. I became increasingly conscious \nof the deep-seated issue prevalent in Pakistan regarding the under-education of women for I could \nhave been one of them, but my mother recognised my affinity for reading and took a stand to \nensure I would not face the very barriers she did. \n \nBiff, Chip and Kipper by Hunt and Brychta \n \nCharlotte’s Web by E. B. White,  \n \nThe Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss \n \nThese classic English children’ books soon accumulated next to my Punjabi ones. Novel and crisp, \nthese books in a foreign language ignited a force within me, a passion and motivation to learn. \nAfter all, I had followed my dreams and moved to Lahore to pursue an education. Nevertheless, it \ncame with its downsides like having to wage a war back at home to receive permission to study, or \nbe surrounded by men in public transport.  \n \nBut Lahore was the land of the books - a city that resembled a library of endless possibilities to \nlearn. Unfortunately, these possibilities isolated my mother, once again, who was not proficient in \nEnglish or Urdu (national language), she found herself constantly reminded of her past. I helplessly \nburied myself in the pages of my books, searching for an escape from reality… \n \nThe ESL Survival Guide by Judie Haynes,  \nCA Asghar, Fatima CEEB:  Fall 2025\n9\nFY REA CAID: 38700070\nPREVIEW\n \nEnglish Vocabulary in Use by McCarthy and O’Dell,  \n \nEnglish for Everyone by Thomas Booth. \n \nThe months following our move to Lahore saw me swearing by these books. Dedicated to helping \nmy mother even though my proficiency was far from perfect and often ushered mockery. I lagged \nbehind in class but I did not want to lose this battle, after all, if my mother could learn it then so \ncould I!  \n \nJournal of Teaching English Language,  \n \nThe Language Learning Journal,  \n \nThe Linguistic Review. \n \nWith time, beginner level reading books transformed into digests, journals, research papers. My \ndreams appeared to be crystallizing, but there was always a looming reminder of my privilege, for \nhundreds of girls in my village did not have access to the same opportunities my mother and I \nenjoy, despite the substandard accommodation we inhabited. We realized that we had found an \nescape and needed to pave the way for our own back at home. So, with the help of some friends \nwe made along the way, my mother and I set up “Nasal” (generation) in our home to uplift women \nin Jhang, connecting them to local handicraft exhibitions so that they can attain financial \nindependence and pursue their dreams - regardless of whether they know English or Urdu.  \n \nHeer Ranjha by Waris Shah,  \n \nMirza Sahiban by Pilu,  \n \nSassi Punnu by Hashim. \n \nWe both find ourselves returning to the very books we started off with, hand in hand, we promise \nto continue on our mission - of learning and empowering.",

Living with them allowed me to acquire these skills, which helped me establish Nasal (Generation), a project aimed at providing financial stability for these women. Through this experience, I gained insight into the patriarchal cycle they endure and identified the key stakeholders contributing to it. One such stakeholder is the local molvi (religious scholar), who openly preaches that men should restrict women's mobility. By engaging with the women in my community, I was able to inform them about their rights and empower them to challenge these limitations.",

I wanted the flexibility to discover new areas in my ALevels to better inform my choices for my bachelor’s degree. The National School became the ideal option, as they were willing to arrange teachers for any subject, even if only one student showed interest. This approach would allow me to pursue my passions without constraints."

The phrase echoes through our house and weighs heavily on my chest . Every word of my relatives’ accusations reminds me that I am being judged for crossing the arbitrary boundaries they have set for me. Mama refuses to see me as guilty. This social hatred contrasts my mother’s acceptance and creates a cognitive dissonance in me ; one that pushes me to explore the epistemological confusion about my beliefs. Habitually, I turn to books for answers. Reading The Long Silence, which follows Jaya, an Indian housewife trapped in a patriarchal family, reassures me that I am not wrong. Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex asserts that “one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman” teaching me that gender identity is shaped by societal expectations. Judith Butler’s theory fully eradicates my dissonance: gender exists only through acts that express it. I realize being 'a woman' is not an inherent identity but a role one continuously performs. This understanding empowers me to stop performing and start being myself. I simply become because I am; free to be, free to live. This freedom entails a curiosity akin to liberation, one that follows neither the binary dictums of man nor woman, of neither jeans nor hijab. With this curiosity, I explore, from Spivak and Hird to Said and Oakley, my expected performance will no longer be my trial.",

Interestingly, ‘weird’ comes from the Old English ‘wyrd,’ meaning ‘fate’ or ‘destiny.’ Shakespeare’s Macbeth linked it to the supernatural, and by the 19th century, it came to mean something odd or out of place, often with a negative connotation. To me, weirdness is essential for innovation. My feminism, my anger, my happiness, my liberation, all deem me ‘weird’ back home. What are some of your oddities? Nothing fazes me, so I hope we find confidants amongst each other. Take Judith Butler, she challenged fixed notions of gender, and many found it aberrant, but they proved to be ground breaking. What are your ground breaking ideas? Do your thoughts run toward quantum physics or perhaps kitchen sink philosophy? Regardless of whether your big idea is a social concept, or an unhinged culinary craving (mine is Cheetos with ice cream), I am curious to listen to whatever you have to say. You’ll learn more about my ‘weird’ habits over time. One is that I like to paste black-and-white photos of influential people—dead or alive—along my bedside, from Joan of Arc to Taylor Swift. I will ensure I leave some space to paste personalities I learn about from you. Less weird: I can stitch! My best skill is breathing life back into frayed clothes, so if any of yours need a little revival, let me know. Looking forward to living together!",

My defining sensation was attending Noorie's wedding, witnessing her fourteen-year-old wrists adorned with bangles heavier than her fate. The global feminist ideas I studied in Lahore had failed Noorie; the lack of brown voices in feminist theory has created a fragmented discourse dominated by western resolutions. That is why we need an inclusive feminist framework that integrates gender studies with social policy reflective of marginalized realities to uplift girls like Noorie. I see myself weaving together the intertwined journeys of rural and urban feminism. By incorporating the womanist theory of Layli Maparyan, I will frame rural feminism as a community centered movement whose core is rooted in intersectionality. My work spans legal empowerment, vocational training, leadership development, and advocacy for reproductive and mental health services. At Stanford, I seek to integrate my framework with Professor Londa Schiebinger’ gendered innovations project. A project that redefines public policy through a gender-sensitive lens. Together we will expose biases that often neglect the needs of marginalized groups. Leading to more tailored programs that empower rural women, ensuring their experiences shape the policies that govern their lives and inspire a new generation of feminists who view inclusivity of the global south as vital for change. Feminism demands that the Noories of tomorrow are liberated on their own terms, free from the notions binding them to futures shaped by dowry exchanges.",
