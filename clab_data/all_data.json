            "personal_statement": "Others may not feel the beating heart of the khet (field) that defines my badminton court but I do. It cradles me like a mother carrying her newborn. It inhales for me when my deviated septum becomes a hurdle for my breathing. Spellbound, I chase this shuttlecock as though it wants to be caught - by none other than me - and I oblige: consistently, o so fervently. Giving up is not a choice because I, my racket, my shuttlecock, and my khet make up a team that shares a dream, and I am the only one who can move without assistance. I simply cannot let them down. Even then, do I belong here - fully? Am I not conflicted between two worlds? Both begin with the letters L - London and Lahore. In fact, they even encompass the same amount of alphabets. Yet, they are as different, as antipodal as sports and economics. A part of me will always be in London, the part I left just there in ninth grade when I migrated to Lahore. A triumph of one romantic city over another. Or was it? Conflicted, I find myself often disconcerted even when amongst my people, in a khet my ancestors took pride in; so much so, that I feel like a shadow. I feel as though I am some traitor - one who could not master my mother tongue. Even then, my khet took me in, humbled me, taught me lessons, gave me uncountable chances, and made me the man I am. More than anything, it offered me the joy of badminton. How can I ever repay the debt? How can I confess my love to it in its two languages, Urdu and Punjabi, that I still remain imperfect in? Somehow giving back, I disallow my crooked septum from hindering my badminton pursuits. This has seemingly progressed into a passion, a conviction - one that I need as much as I need that poorly passed-through oxygen. Fate, however, offers bigger plans. Is it my hard work, determination, or just a miracle? I do not know but following a landmark number of trials and hospital admissions, I ended up in the Pakistan National Badminton team and then the Pakistan Badminton Federation Team’s Under-17 Cohort. Finally, I acquired answers for my identity: this nation owns me and I own it too. I finally feel as though I have given back to my nation in my way. There is freedom; there is felicity in this realization that only my shuttlecock can understand as it flies across to my opponents. Henceforth, I shine in my community because of the shine of my seven gold and four silver medals. They see me as a symbol of hope - something people of my country need now more than ever. And so I know my purpose: I need to do more; I need to expand my horizons, and take inspiration from my long-term companion - my shuttlecock - which has the mobility that Pakistan needs. I must be led by the spirits of my people to become the best version of myself, just as my racket pushes the shuttlecock. So forth, I move towards another, perhaps even stronger passion: policy making. Commencing with eco-policy, I attended the “Green Print for Change, Navigating the Policy Landscape in Environmental Stewardship” conference on Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability. Just as my shuttlecock bounces between me and my opponent, I successfully bounce between badminton, physiotherapy, and activism. Through each publication, experiment, and regression analysis, I feel as though I am fulfilling a promise - to the very khet that grounds me. With this, my goals became clearer: I can make Pakistan as mobile, as fast-paced as my shuttlecock. I can and I will - stronger than the force that I exert on my racket, stronger than the suffocation that my deviated septum induces.",

Where courses like “Modern Urbanisms” and “Narratives of Identity” would let me connect my passions for storytelling and sustainable societal development in a meaningful way, Bryn Mawr's Katharine Houghton Hepburn Center would provide a unique platform to turn these ideas into action.

                "response": "On the last day before summer break, our filmmaking club tasked us with selecting a theme for a documentary, ‘The Faces of Pakistan’ As our group of storytellers brainstormed ideas about education reform, urban poverty, disappearing crafts, one friend, recently moved from Karachi, suggested we focus on Pakistan's rivers: their culture, traditions, and their daily lives. And so,’Darya ki Kahaniyan’ (Tales of the River) began to take shape. The first day of filming was chaotic. We traveled to a small riverside village near Shakoor Lake in Badin district, with our equipment piled into a rickety van, greeted by the sight that left us both curious and unsettled. Fishermen moved with quiet determination, their silhouettes framed against the shimmering, polluted river. Their weary boats, made of aging wood, were lined up in the murky brown water. The water surface was slick with oil and dotted with clumps of blackish green algae. A pungent mix of ammonia assaulted our senses, making it hard to breathe. Our first interview was with an elderly fisherman named Ghulam. His hands were weathered and calloused, face deeply lined, and his voice heavy and worn. He wore a faded kurta, its color lost to time and countless washes, \"The river was alive,\" his eyes glistening. \"But now,it’s choking.The water smells of chemicals. The fish are fewer, smaller, and weaker.\" He spoke of the factories upstream dumping waste into the water, once-clear rivers became contaminated with chemicals, plastics, and toxins. “Ab toh kuch bhi nahi bacha.” (There is nothing left now), he finished. Here I realized that pollution and urbanization are not isolated; my urban environment and their rural one were intricately linked, and the choices we make in cities ripple outward in ways we often fail to see. Each interview brought a new revelation. There was the young father who struggled to feed his family because his daily catch had dwindled to a fraction of what it used to be, and a single mother who worked tirelessly repairing old nets, but still couldn't make enough to support her children. The more we filmed, the more I realized this wasn't just a fisherman's story—it was about all of us, with urban waste and unchecked industrialization choking the river and its people. The camera became more than just a tool; it became a link between two worlds that rarely acknowledged one another. The documentary, which started as a school project, grew into something far bigger. We submitted ‘Darya ki Kahaniyan’ to the National Amateur Short Film Festival (NASFF). Our film won the award for Best Short Documentary. The greatest reward came weeks later when, spurred by the documentary, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency launched a cleanup initiative, penalized factories, imposed stricter regulations, and began efforts to restore the river’s ecosystem. Through ‘Darya ki Kahaniyan’, I realized that I have the power to bring hidden stories to light and to incite action. I’m not just an observer, but an active participant in creating change where it's needed.",

Aiman Fatima presents a compelling throughline that connects her personal history (migration, language loss, family hardship), academic ambitions (environmental studies, sociology, public policy), and lived action (urban greening, documentary impact, policy advocacy). Her story is not just about overcoming obstacles—it is about transforming ecosystems: both literal and social. The application is a masterclass in narrative coherence: the 'shuttlecock' metaphor in her personal statement reflects not just resilience, but her broader philosophical commitment to mobility, justice, and regeneration. From her badminton achievements to environmental activism and filmmaking, every piece affirms a singular truth: she moves with purpose. Her background—a blend of urban middle-class privilege, economic constraint, and deep familial responsibility—adds nuance to her socioeconomic story, marking her as a future changemaker. At an institution like Bryn Mawr, which values agency, interdisciplinarity, and feminist praxis, Aiman would not just thrive—she would lead. This is the kind of application that admissions officers remember at committee: richly human, structurally sophisticated, and deeply mission-aligned."

            "personal_statement": "My first act of reclamation was to plant wild native grasses—Cymbopogon—to revive the neglected plots behind my home. Before I could make sense of the devastation around me, my hands were already digging.  I learned early on that the ground beneath our feet is alive with possibility if you know where to look. My hometown: Chakwal’s soil, once teeming with life, was now suffocated by the creeping sprawl of unchecked industrial development. But I refused to let it die.\n\nAs a child, my most cherished memories are of running barefoot through the countryside, the air thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth. But slowly - the greed of modernity reached Chakwal and it succumbed to the sprawl of factories; it is an indescribably helpless condition - to be in love with the world around you and witness its decay, powerless to challenge a system built on never ending greed. When this sprawl of decay started forcing my community to relocate - abandoning their homes, memorabilia and sustenance, I realized, we, no I, couldn’t let this happen, not without a fight.\n\nI started with rain barrels—rudimentary systems at first, fashioned from reused plastic drums. I worked with local women to construct underground rainwater harvesting systems, ensuring that every drop was accounted for. We planted moisture-loving Typha along the edges of the barrels, soft cattails that thrived with just enough water and signaled where the soil was fertile once more. \n\nUs women, who were already burdened with household duties, became the invisible victims of environmental degradation. As water sources dried up, it was us who traveled further and further to fetch what little was left. The smoke from factories blackened the air, increasing respiratory illnesses among the elderly and children. We were already marginalized in so many ways, now had to bear the brunt of environmental collapse, and no one seemed to notice. This injustice ignited my ambition. If no one would listen to the cries of my fellow women, I would make them hear.\n\nAs I worked to rebuild Chakwal’s women and natural spaces, I turned my attention to the larger picture. How could we develop in a way that didn’t destroy? My question took me deep into the policies that governed rural development. What I found was a system so blind to the nuances of environmental justice that it perpetuated the very inequalities it should be solving. I authored a research paper analyzing the effects of climate change on women’s health in rural Pakistan, focusing specifically on Chakwal. The water scarcity here was no longer just an environmental issue; it was a gendered one. The same policies that failed to protect the environment also ignored the lives of women.\n\nI knew that change couldn’t happen in isolation, so I began leading groups of women in rainwater management projects. Together, we built cisterns and underground storage systems, securing water for 50 families in our village. We planted drought-resistant varieties of Acacia modesta, a tree native to Chakwal, along the peripheries of our homes, their roots digging deep into the parched earth, holding it together in the face of erosion.\n\nWe, the women of Chakwal, with their hands buried in the earth, became part of a larger movement to reclaim what was lost. Each plant we sow, every system we build, is a protest against the destruction of our homeland. Every Prosopis seedling, a tree that can thrive in drought-ridden areas, is witness to our ability to reclaim what industry had taken. We are telling the world that we refused to disappear into the smog.\n\nMy commitment to environmental justice remains unshaken. I have seen firsthand how policy can destroy lives, but I have also witnessed the power of community-led change. No matter how much is taken, we have the power to grow it back, stronger than ever before. And I am determined to make sure that what has been lost will be reclaimed.",

Its chimes, echo ancient rhythms, defying every whisper of doubt, declaring my space on the stage regardless of the gendered norms that define this dance, my dance. As I twirl, a question lingers: In the grand dance of life, do identities shape our movements, or do movements shape identities, a grand scheme of constructionism and conformity?\n\nI move my body in uninhibited agility; the thrum of my soles hitting the floor, enraptured by the Saraiki folk tunes. My feet pirouette in a trance, every step resounding with the memory of my father’s violence: ‘Khusra! (Crossdresser), his voice echoed as his belt lashed across my back, ‘Mere betay ko sab Chaka samjhainge?’ (You want people to think my son is transgender?) he bellows as his palms collide with my shoulders, shoving me into the wall.\n\nConformity leaves no space for my expression of self to exist outside the binaries of gender. There is no sanctuary where my gender ceases to exist and the only echo that resounds is that of my payal. Beautiful and complete in its entirety, free from the labels that gender enforces my passion into. How could I not resent these social dictums that preclude me from pursuing my passions on the mere basis of gender?\n\nAs if synchronized with the pulse of my moves, my uncles offer deprecating provocations. ‘Hassaingay sab iss per’ (People will make a mockery of him). It is alleged that my devotion to this craft entails moral depravity, threatening the very foundations of what constitutes masculinity. The constant barrage of pejoratives diminishes my courage to perform at any public avenue. If only this dance were as simple to abandon as society presumes! So with a heavy heart, I left my home in Mianwali and moved to Islamabad.\n\nHowever, once this alien city transforms into a home for me, a familiar mockery begins to rear its head. Despite its infrastructural generosity and claims of progressivist thinking, my optimism stutters when I recognize the same disdain towards men voluntarily pursuing dance existing in Islamabad. And thus, I am once again rendered a pariah over my so-called effeminate conduct, with nowhere left to go, I turn inward, towards my payal, my jhoomar.\n\nIgnoring all the denunciation, I continue to dance, harmonizing my twirls with the agony I have faced. Matching each strike of my father’s with a resounding thump of my adorned feet against the floor. Henceforth, my healing begins, a source from within. My dance now takes form in another light, before a mere passion, now it is a journey. One I craft myself from inception to end, a performance I name ‘Zoh’, after myself; Because now with my soul slowly breaking free, I understand what resilience looks like, my passion is proof of my ambition to persist, to keep dancing no matter the wound.\n\nFollowing the titillating echoes of my payal, I find others like me. Together, we build a sanctuary: “Jhoomar” (Dancers), a dance collective that choreographs beats and rhythms to the assuaging capacities of music therapy. Encapsulating the essence of my personal dance journey, this initiative seeks to amplify the remedial potency of dance. Our collective endeavors are designed not only to craft movements that act as a therapeutic medium, enhancing emotional well-being but also to narrate cultural stories that challenge and transcend toxic stereotypes. Through Jhoomar, I am finally discovering acceptance, coming a long way from being labeled a cultural renegade for my unorthodox preoccupation.\n\nOrthodoxies, at the end of the day, are social constructs: what may be to you, may not be to me. There is no must! No matter which form I metamorph into next, one truth stands: if the world silences the music, I would still dance to the cadence of my soul and the chime of my payal.",

What elevates this application beyond the usual is the integration of his academic brilliance with his social imagination—an educationist in the making who doesn’t just want to study at Harvard but build the conditions that bring Harvard-like opportunities home. The vulnerability in his personal statement, the specificity in his academic plans, the social relevance of his extracurriculars, and his documented leadership all make him a textbook example of what *Inside the Yale Admissions Office* would call a student who would 'redefine the community around them.'"

            "personal_statement": "Za-har?-mun (She-dreamed) \nZa-har?-yam (He-dreamed) \n\nSame longing — different futures — determined by the weight of gendered grammar. In my village dreams are verbs only men can conjugate. A girl’s aspirations are tethered to the confines of the kitchen, our ambition as disposable as the onion skins we peel. But, you see, dreams have a peculiar resilience: they persist, even when silenced, and my Amma’s (mother) silence taught me to listen closely…. \n\nAmidst evenings filled with stitching and cooking, I sensed her yearning for what she was denied: education, freedom, autonomy. Hers was a world of nailah-jabir? (unjust necessity), where even the act of learning English marked one as ghair (foreign), kafir (infidel). When I declared my interest in studying Aramaic and Hebrew, the murmurs turned to outrage. “This is be-deen (against the faith),” they said. My love for languages was painted as a betrayal of my identity, a refusal against norms that kept women tethered to what was deemed “acceptable.” \n\nBut my father shielded me from these accusations. He witnessed my care for the books I found in Sunday thrift markets, and the clay piggy bank which I emptied monthly to purchase a new research paper. He knew — I meant no harm — I only wanted knowledge, a right, my right; as important for me as it is for a man. Together, my parents became my refuge, insisting that I could be za-har?-mun-da-hawa-yam (she-dreamed-of-flight). \n\nZa-parh?-mun (She-read) \nZa-parh?-yam (He-read) \n\nIn learning languages — English, Aramaic, and later Persian and Hebrew — I discovered a medium of resistance.  \n\nAramic: “Let no one be lost to time,” a reminder of my mother’s sacrifices.  \n\nHebrew: “The world stands on three things: truth, justice, and peace,” gave me a framework for my advocacy. \n\nPersian: “A stone may stay in water for a long time, but it remains unsoaked,” mirrored the endurance I sought to embody.  \n\nZa-da-lafz-ghair-yam (She-spoke-the-foreign) \n\nWith Global Sisterhood Network (GSN), I formed a multilingual team advocating for women’s rights across 13 languages, connecting over 1,000 women — from Pakistan to Egypt. Language was my weapon, but it was also my salve. I trained volunteers to translate resources, guiding women to learn about their rights in legal systems that often ignored their dialects. \n\nIn one case, I worked with a woman from a Punjabi village whose story of domestic violence had been dismissed by authorities because she couldn’t communicate in Urdu. With the support of Global Sisterhood Network, her voice finally carried the weight it deserved, and her husband faced legal consequences. \n\nZa-difa?-mun (She-defended) \nZa-difa?-yam (He-defended) \n\nSame resistance — different recognition. Advocacy is often an act of unlearning before it becomes action. My linguistic excavations showed me that systemic inequality is not just a policy failure but a failure to listen. Words like lakir (boundary) and baradari (kinship) had been weaponized in my village to confine women. At GSN, we showed that a boundary can be a line of protection, and kinship can extend to sisterhood. \n\nZa-da-hawa-sang?n-yam (I-flew-through-storms) \n\nThrough GSN, I began to see that language as a framework for existence. My advocacy is a verb, a dream I will dare to conjugate no matter if I am not a man; for it is one conjugated in every dialect spoken by the women I’ve worked with. \n\nAs I sit with women in remote villages, helping them draft legal documents in Punjabi or translate their rights into Arabic, I think back to Amma. Her silence was not consent; it was survival. Every word I speak, every sentence I translate, is a continuation of the flight she once dreamed of but could not take. Language is my lens, my mirror, and my weapon, but most of all, it is my possibility — my way to create a world where no woman’s story is lost in translation.",

I’m also drawn to COS 324: Intro to Machine Learning, where I can build upon my work as a research assistant using ML to interpret Egyptian hieroglyphs. \n\nThe Humanities Council’s “Pathways to Language Justice” and the Indigenous Studies Interdisciplinary Group particularly excite me. Having founded Global Sisterhood Network, where we translated legal resources into 13 languages for women, I’ve witnessed the urgent need for linguistic equity.\n\nPrinceton's interdisciplinary ethos—where linguistics can converge with AI, classics, and gender theory—is ideal for a student like me who sees language not merely as communication, but as resistance, preservation, and empowerment.",

As a prospective member of this community, reflect on how your lived experiences will impact the conversations you will have in the classroom, the dining hall or other campus spaces.

                "response": "“Purdah” (veil) \n\n“Chaar Diwari” (four walls) \n\n“Ghairat” (honor) \n\nSynonyms for subjugation — declarations that to exist as a woman is to trespass.  \n\n“Be-haya” (shameless) is reserved for those who speak too loudly;  \n\n“Be-izzat” (dishonored) is for those who dare to say no.  \n\nA stark example: Sadaf, my cousin who became a cautionary tale for all the women in my family. \n\nSadaf, was attacked by a man, emboldened by a culture that deems rejection as rebellion, who threw acid on her for refusing his marriage proposal. Hundreds of cases of acid attacks are reported annually in Pakistan, but most go unacknowledged, buried under the weight of “izzat” (family honor). In our linguistic prison, whispers spread faster than her scars healed: “Girls shouldn’t provoke men.” \n\nFor months, I lived with a choking fear. I avoided mirrors, worried that I might one day reflect Sadaf’s fate. Words that were supposed to \"protect\" me —“chup” (silence), “modesty”, “obedience”—became iron bars. But words cut both ways.  \n\nIn my isolation, I stumbled across stories of survival: Rukhsana, who rebuilt her life after an acid attack by opening her own clothing business; the work of Dr. Fouzia Saeed, whose advocacy redefined workplace harassment laws; Ayesha Siddiqa’s Military Inc., which dissected power structures with unapologetic precision. These were revolutions written by women who refused to be erased. \n\nAnd then, I met Sadaf again, whose words have stayed with me ever since. \n\n\"Don’t pity me,\" Her courage to live had been forged in pain, and in the face of such power I refused to stay in fear. \n\nFor Sadaf’s courage – for mine, and the countless women who live in fear this system sows, I founded Faces of Courage, my declaration that we as women would no longer hide. With a team of eight, we taught 50 survivors vocational and creative skills, organized mental health workshops, and secured six jobs through partnerships with NGOs. But the work was more than numbers. It was in the hands of women stitching embroidery for the first time, their fingers hesitant but determined. It was in the laughter of a survivor learning to paint, reclaiming the brush that her attacker thought he’d stolen forever. \n\nThe opposition was relentless. “Why teach them skills?” “Why give them jobs?” Acid attack survivors, to many, are unworthy of a second chance, relegated to lives hidden in shame. I was accused of disrupting the “natural order,” of tarnishing my family’s name by speaking out. But if speaking against power is a sin, I’ve learned to wear it as a badge of honor. \n\nAt first, my voice trembled; now it resounds. I burn with courage, as does every woman who has walked through the doors of Faces of Courage. Sadaf taught me that words can imprison, but they can also ignite. “Hope,” “resistance”—these are the words we now live by. \n\nI see a world where women are no longer confined by language but freed by it; a narrative I rewrite every day.",

Among classmates and competitions I’ve attended across Pakistan, no one has heard of my language, let alone speaks it. For my grandparents, who learned Urdu and Punjabi as adults to integrate into wider society, Burushaski is their soul — a living archive of which we are the museums.  \n\nLanguage preservation wasn’t always my calling. That began with Ashraf, the local bookseller who handed me a copy of The Lightning Thief: my foray into Greek mythology. That one book cascaded into a love for the languages and histories, but alongside my awe came the heartbreak of realizing they were gone.  \n\nTheir decline mirrored Burushaski, and that realization lit a fire in me to act before my language, too, became a relic. I began small: creating a three-dialect dictionary with my school’s language society and uploading it to a website I designed. To draw attention to the language’s precarious state, I designed apparel printed with Burushaski phrases — turning an endangered tongue into a conversation starter.  \n\nBut I knew I couldn’t stop there. My research project on decoding Egyptian hieroglyphs using machine-learning showed me the vast potential of technology in preserving dying languages. Now, I dream of developing computational tools to analyze linguistic structures and create digital-archives for endangered languages like Burushaski.  \n\nMy language is my identity and I hope to take these efforts global, ensuring no language is lost to silence.",

Her core identity—as a computational linguist leveraging AI to preserve endangered languages and fight for women’s rights—permeates every layer of her application. Unlike generic 'well-rounded' profiles, Aaima demonstrates a spike in a rare and intersectional field: feminist computational linguistics. From decoding Egyptian hieroglyphs using machine learning to founding the Global Sisterhood Network across 13 languages, her work is deeply original, community-centered, and scalable. The intellectual maturity shown in her independent research papers rivals that of college juniors. Her essays exemplify Ethan Sawyer’s principles—specificity, transformation, and vulnerability—especially through metaphoric prose and code-switching that demonstrate emotional and linguistic fluency. As admissions officers, we look for students who will not only thrive in academic settings but also transform campus culture. Aaima fits the Princeton mold of service-oriented scholarship, the Stanford maker mindset, and MIT’s hands-on approach to impact. Her lived experience as a Pakistani girl navigating linguistic boundaries and systemic patriarchy gives her a distinct lens on global equity, which she translates into real-world solutions—from trilingual dictionaries to legal aid for rural women. She is not a student who fits the mold. She redefines it. This is the kind of application that excites a committee not just for what the student has done—but for what she will build next. She is the future of the liberal arts in the age of algorithms."

We are Kashmiri migrants — tillers but never owners, laborers bound to feudal lords tethered to ideals of entrenched discrimination. The disdain of the upper caste landowners (chowdhuries) spread through the community like gossypium wilt. Whispers of “yeh Kashmiri log” (these Kashmiris) seep into the cracks of our lives and education is denied to us – as though literacy is a luxury reserved for the soil’s owners, not its servants. Abba, however, refused to let the blight of this ostracism seep into my destiny. So, while my hands harvested another man’s crop by day, my nights were spent poring over stolen glimpses of school books, their ink a promise that I might one day heal more than fields. In the fields, pathogens attack weakened roots. When I finally entered school, it was not without whispers of protest from the same community that had relegated us to the periphery. “Yeh log padh kar kya karenge?” (What will these people accomplish through education?) But I learned: to read, write and observe. In the yellowing citrus orchards surrounding our village, I noticed a sickness spreading through the trees: Huanglongbing (HLB), a bacterial disease that devastates citrus yields. The pathogen responsible, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, moves stealthily through the veins of the tree. It was here that the metaphor crystallized: if we can decode the DNA of this pathogen, if we can trace its mutations and map its spread, then perhaps we can do the same for the diseases that corroded human systems — inequality, ostracism, prejudice. Abba’s sacrifices — moving to a city rent house so I can hold a pen instead of a plow — propelled me into research. At the Punjab Agriculture Research Center, I developed molecular markers for DNA barcoding Diaphorina citri, the vector of the HLB pathogen. My work centered on amplifying mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and ribosomal ITS2 regions through PCR, a process that mirrors my own experience of amplification: taking the whispers of my Kashmiri identity and making them resonate. Gel electrophoresis confirms product specificity and as I sequence the DNA and identify four genetic clusters among 50 individuals, I think of the ways our own social structures divide us into haplotypes: by caste, ethnicity, religion. Diseases like HLB cannot be eradicated overnight, nor can centuries of systemic inequality. But what they share is a common antidote: targeted intervention. The DNA barcoding technique I developed provides a high-resolution tool for tracking Diaphorina citri variants, enabling region-    specific pest management strategies. Similarly, I realized that understanding the variations within my own community — its histories, its traumas, its strengths—was key to devising solutions. Returning to the village that had once denied me the right to education, I founded a program to teach scientific literacy to young children in my ethnic tribe, many of whom are still barred from attending school. I designed workshops that integrated concepts from my research into hands-on activities, such as mapping phylogenetic trees with colored yarn or simulating PCR with beads and strings. These sessions emulate agency — giving my kin the tools to decode the systems that sought to limit them. When the same chowdhuries ,who had once sneered at my father’s dream for me, attended a community seminar where I presented my findings, their skepticism gave way to curiosity, then respect — an admission that the barriers they had erected are not insurmountable. As I continue my work, I carry with me the lessons of the field: we are all connected by invisible threads — haplotypes in a shared human genome. And so, I persist, ensuring that neither disease nor prejudice will define the harvest of the future. Mitti kabhi haar nahi maanti (the soil never gives up). Nor will I",

From chicken farming to experimenting with biology, my journey has been unconventional, to say the least.

Happy chickens and a whole lot of eggs, which I regularly donate to orphanages—community science at its finest. I’m intrigued by Princeton’s approach to encouraging interdisciplinary connections—because where else could an scientist-in-training with a love for chicken farming also dive into classes on public policy and environmental ethics? I see myself exploring biology, agriculture, and even entrepreneurship through the College’s open curriculum. Princeton’s Environmental Studies Program, with its interdisciplinary approach, offers the perfect platform to connect my work in sustainable farming with academic research. Additionally,who knows, the learnings from Keller Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship may some day help me take my home-grown research and turn it into a start-up that revolutionizes sustainable farming. Or at the very least, I’ll leave with a deeper understanding of how science and society intertwine (while keeping my chickens happy). Princeton’s mix of academic rigor and flexibility will help me continue asking weird but important questions: How do we feed the world sustainably? And can chickens be the key to it all?",

                "response": "The soil of Sialkot clung to my father’s hands, cracked and calloused from a lifetime of labor, and settled in my mother’s silence—a silence heavier than words, teaching me that love is sacrifice, and strength is quiet endurance. I was born into this soil, its whispers shaping my world: “Don’t dream too big.” “Know your place.” My parents—bound to the earth—poured their lives into survival, a defiance in itself. Yet even as a child, I felt the soil beneath my feet trembling, as if begging me to rise, to break free, to be more than the dust I stood on. When I left Sialkot for Hasanabdal, I thought I’d escaped those whispers, but they clung to me like shadows. In the halls of that boarding school, they took new shapes, new voices: “Kashmiri scientist? Go free Kashmir. Their laughter cut deeper, the walls amplifying their doubt. My dreams felt fragile, trembling under the weight of their scorn. But somewhere deep within me, a quiet defiance stirred—refusing to let the laughter shatter what little hope I carried. In those moments, I turned to what I knew: bridging. I founded Cake Club, a place where prisoners like me could share laughter tearing down barriers we never knew we’d built. However, my heart was still in Sialkot. Every time I returned home,I saw my mother, her hands blistered from work no one acknowledged. She was my first lesson in resilience, but also my first heartbreak. I created Roshan Raasta, for women like Amma, to give them hope to reclaim their voices. Together, we turned barren fields into places of life and dignity. For the first time, I saw my mother smile—not the fleeting smile of endurance, but the unguarded joy of pride. In Sialkot’s fields, citrus greening stole more than crops—it stole my father’s dreams and broke countless hearts. I chased CRISPR-Cas9 research to fight back, and now, by collaborating with Professors at GAO Lab, China, I am pursuing my mission of creating disease-resistant crops—so no dream has to die in the soil again. At Princeton, I will bring these stories—the soil-stained lessons of Sialkot and the sharp edges of Hasanabdal. I will bring the silence of my mother and the defiance of a boy who dared to dream. My classmates will learn that strength is born in the quietest struggles, that community is built one connection at a time, and that even the hardest soil can bloom. This is who I am: the child of soil, the builder of bridges, the dreamer of impossible dreams. And this is the truth I will carry into every conversation: that from pain grows purpose, and from purpose grows change.",

From an admissions officer’s lens—especially within a 'Gatekeepers' or 'Who Gets In and Why' framework—it stands out for its rich, culturally embedded metaphors and multidimensional impact. The applicant doesn’t merely recount hardship; he repurposes it into innovation, blending environmental biotechnology with village revitalization. He doesn’t perform resilience; he reflects it through actions like founding Roshan Raasta and the Cake Club. The writing style itself evokes the narrative maturity of top-tier Ivy essays—mirroring the techniques outlined by Ethan Sawyer in 'College Essay Essentials': vulnerability, vivid imagery, earned wisdom, and specific transformation. The essay also signals what Princeton calls 'service through scholarship'—his lived experience is not baggage, but ballast. It anchors his sense of purpose and offers classmates a mirror to reflect on their own privilege, silence, and responsibility. His story becomes not just one of overcoming, but one of catalyzing community renewal. That’s Ivy League material."

The money? survival. A fleeting escape. I asked myself, “Kitabon ka kya faida, jab roti ka sawal ho?” (\"What good are books when bread is the question?\") I used the money donated for education for anything but education. Survival made dreams feel distant, unreachable! But then, CCH came. A chance. A doorway. I saw what could be. What I could be. What my friends could be! Now Books in hand, I walked the dusty paths of my village, my heart heavy with what could have been. Without CCH, I was one of them—children calloused hands, dreams crushed by survival. Generations chained to survival needed a shift—a mindset unshackled from hopelessness. I began “Umeed Ka Safar,” connecting families with public service employees. I sat with parents, pleading, “Bachay khet ke liye nahi, kal ke liye hain” (\"Children are for the future, not the fields\"). We raised $3k, sending 30+ children to schools, shifting parental mindset from survival to education. Because their dreams could have been mine. And I will fight for them to rise.",

The applicant moves from a place of deep material scarcity—selling pages from donated textbooks—to organizing a village-wide movement advocating for children’s education. That’s not just service—it’s structural intervention, born of lived experience. From an admissions lens, it reflects the 'service-driven scholar' ideal: someone who acts not out of resume padding, but out of existential recognition. The linguistic duality (Urdu-English) adds cultural specificity and emotional realism, while the use of physical symbols (the bat, the books) anchors the narrative in visual storytelling, echoing models from '50 Successful Ivy League Essays'. It doesn’t romanticize poverty; it interrogates it and mobilizes against it. For an institution like Princeton, which values 'informed service', this essay is a declaration that the applicant won’t just benefit from Princeton—he’ll multiply its mission in the lives of others."

His 'spike' is clearly in biology and bioengineering, demonstrated through multiple high-impact research initiatives (e.g., CRISPR, DNA barcoding, microbiome analysis), many of which address urgent real-world problems in agriculture and public health. Yet unlike many science applicants, Ali transcends lab achievements by anchoring his work in a deep understanding of social injustice — caste oppression, rural exclusion, and educational inequity — and channeling his scientific skills toward dismantling those systems. \n\nFrom his personal statement’s symbolic use of pathogens and PCR as metaphors for prejudice and identity to his grassroots innovations like TerraWrap and 'Umeed Ka Safar', every component reinforces his central narrative: knowledge as liberation. His leadership is not performative — it’s restorative. He brings education to children and dignity to female farmers. He doesn’t just participate in global research, he repurposes it for marginalized communities.\n\nWhat makes this application elite-admissions-worthy is its *layered intentionality*: the essays are emotionally intelligent and thematically resonant; the activities show sustained impact and originality; the honors reflect national and international recognition; and the academic-extracurricular synergy is powerful. He models what Jeff Selingo calls a 'service-driven scholar,' and his authentic, unpolished courage — evidenced by quoting Urdu metaphors and building biodegradable plastics from corn husks — reveals a rare synthesis of humility, vision, and intellect. This is not just a compelling applicant. This is the future Princeton hopes to cultivate."

While they played, I watched and watched - beguiled by these creations they call Toys. What else could lure seven-year-old Omer, other than Toys? Gazing through the thick glass pane, past a mosaic of remote-controlled cars, I was head over heels - for these other-worldly rows laden with Marvel's sturdy action figures. Parked at the street's terminus, the toy store became a daily rendezvous, a haven before and after school. This ‘window shopping’ of mine replaced tangible play - assuaging the solitude of solo bus rides with dreams that lingered until the school bus echoed its piercing horn. Toys……These ones - displayed in ‘WonderToys!’ - seemed different, from the ones I borrowed from neighborhood garbage bins. ‘Pre-loved’ proved a more fitting label than mere junk. Salvaging stray templates and frames, each Toy was a canvas and a challenge - to recycle its past into a new future. Each Toy heralded a long journey of remodeling and re-engineering - resisting society’s readiness to cast it aside as garbage. In my dainty fingers, the toy would cease being trash. Enter Dr. Omer, the conjurer of whimsical transformations; the Creator of Toys! In youthful explorations, playtime sparked a curiosity to unravel the science behind contraptions and repurposing. Lurking within STEM journals, I found inspiration in works like Don Norman's ‘The Design of Everyday Things’ and Samuel Florman's relatable ‘The Existential Pleasures of Engineering.’ Toys thus, became a manifesto for sustainable joy - embodying constant recreation. From Recycled Robot Sculptures made of old tin cans to budget-friendly Virtual Reality Goggles fashioned from discarded eyewear, my little workshop echoed my commitment. Awards like ‘Creator of Engineer’ and ‘Junior Science Champ’ validated my dedication, rooted in a childhood love for Toys and the limitless possibilities they offered. Committed to this devotion, I tenderly touch my lab coat, fueled by the ambition to engineer Toys—this time, for a greater cause. Initiating the Khilonay project, my team of 14 adolescent engineers and I conduct toy-making workshops at The Indus Hospital for children afflicted with the Polio Virus. Mirroring my childhood fascination, we employ recyclable materials for Khilonay - a passion project that believes in every child’s right to play and hence, our duty to engineer: Sketch how recyclable cardboard and metal components can harmonize to form the Toy of your imagination Select recyclable cardboard and salvaged metal parts that align with the design, emphasizing both durability and functionality Assemble a prototype with the chosen materials according to the sketch Add interactive elements to the toy to enhance its appearance Commence playtime! In six months of dedicated effort, we have readied Toys for 277 children, our lab coats endorsing the marks of our tireless labor. Yet, we don't dwell on worn attire; each frayed thread symbolizes a purpose etched on our decorated laboratory coats—a blessing that encapsulates our mission on this planet. Now, I don this very lab coat, as my team goes from crafting Toys to engineering shelter houses - crafting environmentally friendly houses: a traditional mud-brick design paired with eco-friendly insulation. Our innovative layout, tailored for Pakistan's arid regions, promises to lower indoor temperatures by 5°C, making it an optimal choice for pastoral households nationwide. This is not the end; it is just the beginning - of the end of unsustainable, carbon-fuming engineering. It is the beginning of a new era - of creating, composing, and constructing - all without compromising the sanctity of planet Earth. On some days, these will be Toys for the Children of today and tomorrow; on other days these will be shelters for our Citizens. From gazing inside 'WonderToys' to serving both child's joy and humanity - it is a spark of childhood wonder fueling a relentless drive for sustainable and innovative creation.",

My community-involved approach resulted in a groundbreaking design, reducing indoor temperatures by 5 degrees Celsius during field tests. Beyond technical success, the initiative empowered communities with new skills and jobs, illustrating the transformative impact of sustainable engineering. My pursuit finds home within the ethos of Engineers without Borders (EWB) at Princeton. Amplifying my efforts through collaborative cross-functionality with EWB, I hope my dreams of sustainable engineering will transcend borders. Developing proper infrastructure and water facilities to underdeveloped areas in villages of all third peripheries, with EWB my vision expands trifold, limited by none other than my own imagination. Maria Garlock’s research on Innovative Structural Design for Earthquake, Fire, and Storm Surge runs parallel to mine at Punjab EPA, where I analyzed the impact of construction on the Murree- Tehsil region and studied the load-bearing capacity of 40+ structures. Under her guidance the horizon of disaster management’s amalgamation with engineering bypasses all dampers. For summers, the calling of home falls short in comparison to the excitement that researching at the Moini Lab offers. Joining Princeton's legacy, I see myself as a gardener, planting seeds of sustainable innovation in the fertile grounds of collaborative research and community engagement, nurturing them to blossom into solutions that cool the hearths of homes and warm the hearts of communities.",

                "response": "With soft loamy soil under my feet, I work barefoot - embarking on designing and constructing houses in Adrana. My work - despite the grit of the dirt beneath me, harkens me over the moon - as if I am a part of something larger - a pilgrimage. Embracing my role as a 3D Designer for the Architectural Project for the Homeless, in collaboration with the University of Punjab, I am entrusted with the task of crafting sustainable abodes for the homeless. Employing advanced computer-aided design (CAD) techniques, I meticulously develop intricate 3D prototypes, contributing to the comprehensive mapping of these structures. Under the invaluable guidance of esteemed professors dedicated to development, this journey embodies a commitment to forging positive change and creating havens of hope for those in need. This endeavor transcends mere mechanics; it's a journey, resonating with deep emotion and a profound attachment to the cause. These villages bear the lingering scars of devastating floods, entire regions in Punjab decimated, living spaces erased, and cherished ways of life obliterated. These communities are not strangers; they echo the familiar landscape of my own, sharing borders, and tragedies of rendering children my age homeless, without shelter, and utterly helpless: a fate that was mine in the 2011 floods as raging waters flooded our village and left us desolate and ravaged. I am now less enamored by scale, less galvanized by the prospect of beauty- my purpose, rather, has been extended to wanting to create an impact by safeguarding: a vanguard against the threats that echo every year. Now, I wish to reconstruct the community, and be a more active member of it entirely - my priorities have changed, marred by tragedy I vow to be the difference that protects others against the catastrophe that was mine. I am wary of taking life’s treasures for granted. Housing is a luxury for so many in my land- a matter of lottery, regardless of the shape and size it comes in. My eyes have opened to the sheer scale of disparities within housing rights, especially in rural villages similar to mine. Parallel to rural orthodoxies, how slums are inherently developed with a lack of sustainability, and yet, paradoxically, are the permanent homes for so many. I hope then, to combat this by ensuring sustainable material - even if this demands unanticipated aggressive crowdfunding efforts - for this is the obligation of the community - to safeguard, to protect, to share.",

My life began at the cross-stitch of Punjab and Sindh - a vibrant intersection of Saraiki and Punjabi. My father from the former and mother from the latter, the language of love was often lost in translation. Despite warmth, there was a chill in the spaces between words understood and sentiments shared, a tangible testament to the division that language and culture sowed. It is from this personal narrative that Mushtarak was born. Within its embrace, 60+ people from diverse provincial backgrounds found a common language. We dismantled barriers with the gentle, persistent flow of mutual respect and understanding. Our workshops were not mere meetings; they were the loom on which we wove a new fabric of society, where the threads of cultural diversity strengthened rather than divided. With Mushtarak I have stood at the confluence of cultures, not as a bystander but as a bridge. Where once the words of my parents stumbled, lost in translation, I now find them in the smiles of children who speak the universal language of acceptance. From warmth of shared laughter in a Saraiki poem to strength found in a Punjabi proverb, I've learned that service is not just about building bridges but also about crossing them. In Mushtarak, I have not only founded an organization but fostered a family. Language of the heart is universal, and when we dare to speak it, the world listens and transforms.",

The student successfully weaves a profound personal story of childhood deprivation into a mission-driven engineering and civic identity, showing growth from curiosity to leadership, from play to purpose. His spike in STEM — evidenced through research with governmental and university partners, prestigious competition outcomes, and deep CAD/3D technical experience — is rare and elite. But what distinguishes him further is the humanization of this STEM profile: every project addresses a social wound — housing crises, disability inclusion, cultural fragmentation, flood displacement. His service-driven ventures (EcoDwell, Khilonay, Mushtarak) are not performative but rooted in authentic lived experience, and he demonstrates not just empathy but a capacity to engineer solutions for systemic problems. His personal statement is emotionally layered, his supplements show institutional fit with Princeton’s Engineers Without Borders, and his essays center community healing over personal accolades. This applicant exemplifies what *The Gatekeepers* calls the 'citizen-scholar': intellectually driven, emotionally aware, civically rooted. His narrative reflects not only a world-class maker mindset but a moral compass oriented toward justice. Princeton would not merely admit him; it would be proud to amplify his impact."

I read books to escape the grim reality \nof life, and oftentimes find it adding meaning and purpose to my life, connecting me with my inner \nself. My books are like “intersectionality” to Kimberley Crenshaw or “gender performativity” to \nJudith Butler or “hegemonic masculinity” to Raewyn Connell. So, without delay, allow me to \nintroduce you to my books… \n \nHeer Ranjha by Waris Shah,  \n \nMirza Sahiban by Pilu,  \n \nSassi Punnu by Hashim.  \n \nEach of these books are heirlooms of Punjabi folklore, treasured by young readers for their moral \nteachings. It was only natural for me to read these stories because it was my native language in \nJhang, but more importantly, this was the only language my mother comprehended. My beautiful \nAmma Jan, wronged by conservative cultural norms, was divorced from attaining an education.  \n \nOvertime, this created a gap between us. It was, however, Punjabi children’s stories that \nstrengthened our bond and brought my mother out of isolation. I became increasingly conscious \nof the deep-seated issue prevalent in Pakistan regarding the under-education of women for I could \nhave been one of them, but my mother recognised my affinity for reading and took a stand to \nensure I would not face the very barriers she did. \n \nBiff, Chip and Kipper by Hunt and Brychta \n \nCharlotte’s Web by E. B. White,  \n \nThe Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss \n \nThese classic English children’ books soon accumulated next to my Punjabi ones. Novel and crisp, \nthese books in a foreign language ignited a force within me, a passion and motivation to learn. \nAfter all, I had followed my dreams and moved to Lahore to pursue an education. Nevertheless, it \ncame with its downsides like having to wage a war back at home to receive permission to study, or \nbe surrounded by men in public transport.  \n \nBut Lahore was the land of the books - a city that resembled a library of endless possibilities to \nlearn. Unfortunately, these possibilities isolated my mother, once again, who was not proficient in \nEnglish or Urdu (national language), she found herself constantly reminded of her past. I helplessly \nburied myself in the pages of my books, searching for an escape from reality… \n \nThe ESL Survival Guide by Judie Haynes,  \nCA Asghar, Fatima CEEB:  Fall 2025\n9\nFY REA CAID: 38700070\nPREVIEW\n \nEnglish Vocabulary in Use by McCarthy and O’Dell,  \n \nEnglish for Everyone by Thomas Booth. \n \nThe months following our move to Lahore saw me swearing by these books. Dedicated to helping \nmy mother even though my proficiency was far from perfect and often ushered mockery. I lagged \nbehind in class but I did not want to lose this battle, after all, if my mother could learn it then so \ncould I!  \n \nJournal of Teaching English Language,  \n \nThe Language Learning Journal,  \n \nThe Linguistic Review. \n \nWith time, beginner level reading books transformed into digests, journals, research papers. My \ndreams appeared to be crystallizing, but there was always a looming reminder of my privilege, for \nhundreds of girls in my village did not have access to the same opportunities my mother and I \nenjoy, despite the substandard accommodation we inhabited. We realized that we had found an \nescape and needed to pave the way for our own back at home. So, with the help of some friends \nwe made along the way, my mother and I set up “Nasal” (generation) in our home to uplift women \nin Jhang, connecting them to local handicraft exhibitions so that they can attain financial \nindependence and pursue their dreams - regardless of whether they know English or Urdu.  \n \nHeer Ranjha by Waris Shah,  \n \nMirza Sahiban by Pilu,  \n \nSassi Punnu by Hashim. \n \nWe both find ourselves returning to the very books we started off with, hand in hand, we promise \nto continue on our mission - of learning and empowering.",

Living with them allowed me to acquire these skills, which helped me establish Nasal (Generation), a project aimed at providing financial stability for these women. Through this experience, I gained insight into the patriarchal cycle they endure and identified the key stakeholders contributing to it. One such stakeholder is the local molvi (religious scholar), who openly preaches that men should restrict women's mobility. By engaging with the women in my community, I was able to inform them about their rights and empower them to challenge these limitations.",

I wanted the flexibility to discover new areas in my ALevels to better inform my choices for my bachelor’s degree. The National School became the ideal option, as they were willing to arrange teachers for any subject, even if only one student showed interest. This approach would allow me to pursue my passions without constraints."

The phrase echoes through our house and weighs heavily on my chest . Every word of my relatives’ accusations reminds me that I am being judged for crossing the arbitrary boundaries they have set for me. Mama refuses to see me as guilty. This social hatred contrasts my mother’s acceptance and creates a cognitive dissonance in me ; one that pushes me to explore the epistemological confusion about my beliefs. Habitually, I turn to books for answers. Reading The Long Silence, which follows Jaya, an Indian housewife trapped in a patriarchal family, reassures me that I am not wrong. Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex asserts that “one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman” teaching me that gender identity is shaped by societal expectations. Judith Butler’s theory fully eradicates my dissonance: gender exists only through acts that express it. I realize being 'a woman' is not an inherent identity but a role one continuously performs. This understanding empowers me to stop performing and start being myself. I simply become because I am; free to be, free to live. This freedom entails a curiosity akin to liberation, one that follows neither the binary dictums of man nor woman, of neither jeans nor hijab. With this curiosity, I explore, from Spivak and Hird to Said and Oakley, my expected performance will no longer be my trial.",

Interestingly, ‘weird’ comes from the Old English ‘wyrd,’ meaning ‘fate’ or ‘destiny.’ Shakespeare’s Macbeth linked it to the supernatural, and by the 19th century, it came to mean something odd or out of place, often with a negative connotation. To me, weirdness is essential for innovation. My feminism, my anger, my happiness, my liberation, all deem me ‘weird’ back home. What are some of your oddities? Nothing fazes me, so I hope we find confidants amongst each other. Take Judith Butler, she challenged fixed notions of gender, and many found it aberrant, but they proved to be ground breaking. What are your ground breaking ideas? Do your thoughts run toward quantum physics or perhaps kitchen sink philosophy? Regardless of whether your big idea is a social concept, or an unhinged culinary craving (mine is Cheetos with ice cream), I am curious to listen to whatever you have to say. You’ll learn more about my ‘weird’ habits over time. One is that I like to paste black-and-white photos of influential people—dead or alive—along my bedside, from Joan of Arc to Taylor Swift. I will ensure I leave some space to paste personalities I learn about from you. Less weird: I can stitch! My best skill is breathing life back into frayed clothes, so if any of yours need a little revival, let me know. Looking forward to living together!",

My defining sensation was attending Noorie's wedding, witnessing her fourteen-year-old wrists adorned with bangles heavier than her fate. The global feminist ideas I studied in Lahore had failed Noorie; the lack of brown voices in feminist theory has created a fragmented discourse dominated by western resolutions. That is why we need an inclusive feminist framework that integrates gender studies with social policy reflective of marginalized realities to uplift girls like Noorie. I see myself weaving together the intertwined journeys of rural and urban feminism. By incorporating the womanist theory of Layli Maparyan, I will frame rural feminism as a community centered movement whose core is rooted in intersectionality. My work spans legal empowerment, vocational training, leadership development, and advocacy for reproductive and mental health services. At Stanford, I seek to integrate my framework with Professor Londa Schiebinger’ gendered innovations project. A project that redefines public policy through a gender-sensitive lens. Together we will expose biases that often neglect the needs of marginalized groups. Leading to more tailored programs that empower rural women, ensuring their experiences shape the policies that govern their lives and inspire a new generation of feminists who view inclusivity of the global south as vital for change. Feminism demands that the Noories of tomorrow are liberated on their own terms, free from the notions binding them to futures shaped by dowry exchanges.",

            "personal_statement": "Much like the constellations above that guide us, each gemstone I work with reflects an essence waiting to be refined—a hidden resilience. Each stone’s color, energy, and purpose connect with the stars, as if pulling stories from the night sky into something tangible. In choosing, shaping, and setting stones, I discovered my own journey of healing—an odyssey refracted through isolation, hope, and transformation. Selecting the right stone is the first, crucial step of the process. Each stone holds a unique vibration. Like the garnet in January, I desperately needed strength and confidence as I faced alienation due to my LGBTQ identity. The world around me felt brittle and cold, rejecting me like a foreign fragment, my identity buried like an uncut gem. I’d once thought of myself as flawed, but once I worked with my gems , I began to wonder: What if, like gemstones, the hidden parts of me only needed to be unearthed and refined? February’s amethyst, the stone of healing, inspired me to look inward, and for the first time, I felt the stirring of self-acceptance, a glimmer that maybe I had something to offer. The grueling steps of cutting and polishing revealed to me the beauty within the rough, jagged edges. March’s aquamarine, a symbol of courage, became my guide as I took my first steps toward growth. Each cut mirrored the emotional wounds I was processing, the fractures from a world that didn’t understand. Polishing these surfaces took time and patience, and in that space, I began to accept myself as I was. April’s diamond of resilience taught me to wear my scars like a mark of survival and pride. With each piece, I felt a metamorphosis, as though I were reshaping myself alongside the gemstones, honing both their edges and my own. Bending and shaping the metal to cradle each stone taught me strength and gentleness. In shaping May’s emerald, the stone of growth, I had to bend without breaking, learning to embrace my journey while finding ways to lift others. Pearl, June’s hidden beauty, reminded me of the importance of solidarity. In my search for support, I found others facing similar struggles, a reminder that I was not alone. We were gems in the making, each of us trying to find our place in a world that often felt too rigid and unforgiving. It was in this spirit that I founded *Noor*—“light”—a jewelry business in partnership with a transrights NGO. With July’s ruby of passion, I was motivated to create a beacon of hope, a way for the LGBTQ and trans communities to find financial independence and stability. Like August’s peridot, symbol of abundance, I hoped *Noor* would be a bridge toward self-sufficiency for others to thrive in a world that so often denied them opportunities. The final step in jewelry making is linking each clasp and setting each gem, bringing the piece together in a unified design. In crafting each piece, I saw my own journey reflected—how far I’d come and how much we had transformed together. September’s sapphire of wisdom, embodied the knowledge gained from my struggles, while October’s opal, a stone of transformation, mirrored my growth as I worked with others at *Noor*. Through helping others on their paths, I realized my purpose: to help people find their own light amidst the shadows, guiding them as gem making had guided me. Setting the intention behind each piece is the final act, imbuing it with cosmic energy and meaning. Like the stones I work with, each person deserves to shine, to break free from the world’s rigid molds and find a future shaped by their own hands. In the vastness of the universe, we are all like gemstones—multifaceted, resilient, and waiting to reflect our own light. As I work with each piece, I am reminded that, like the constellations, we each hold the potential to illuminate even the darkest night.",

                "response": "I sketched Orion’s silhouette standing on the barren plains of Mars. Orion chose to leave Earth and seeked refuge among the stars, but he encountered suspicion by a colony, controlled by a fanatical organization, that believed in the superiority of its kind. “You disrupt our order,” the colony leader declared. “Mars is for those who conform.” Banished to the endless red sands, Orion wandered and questioned if the universe could ever hold a place for someone like him. I had been sketching pieces of my own story all along. Like Orion, I had wondered if I was asking too much—too much of my father, whose words, when I sought his acceptance, felt suffocating. “Why can’t you just be normal?” I sought his acceptance as someone who loved differently. My father dismissed the humanity of anyone like me and clinged to a worldview where people like us didn’t belong. I reflected often on his words, trying to reconcile my love for him with the pain his rejection caused, but they pressed against me like the red skies above Orion. My comics became my quiet rebellion in crafting a world where everyone could exist freely. Orion searched for a trace of himself in the vast red expanse to end up finding others who had been silenced and cast away. Together, they turned the barren sands of Mars into a haven and carved out a community where differences were celebrated and identities embraced. Like Maria Mitchell, I want to find “imagination in science,” and allow my stories to shine with a purity and wisdom that only a shared sky can inspire. At Vassar, I will organise workshops in the LGBTQ Center and Vassar Not Alone (VNA) where students can channel their personal experiences into art and storytelling to give voice to their identities.",

Through intersecting lenses of cosmology, queerness, art, and science, Muhammad Ahmad Raza constructs a multidimensional identity that is intellectually vibrant and socially urgent. His personal statement and supplemental essays are among the most artfully layered and emotionally resonant, successfully embodying the Ethan Sawyer model of vulnerability plus vision. He doesn't just tell us about exclusion—he transforms it into communal healing through storytelling, jewelry-making, policy analysis, and grassroots education. His academic excellence—evidenced by a 4.0 GPA, Cambridge A-Level predictions, and SAT scores—supports the intellectual rigor required at elite liberal arts colleges. What makes him exceptional, however, is not just his academic merit, but his deeply integrated personal mission: to create beauty, meaning, and opportunity in spaces where there was once erasure. His leadership across LGBTQ+ advocacy, science communication, and interdisciplinary art fulfills nearly every category elite colleges seek—intellectual vitality, community contribution, unique voice, and institutional match. His story is not just one of overcoming, but of reframing: transforming marginality into radiance. This is the kind of student who doesn't just succeed at Vassar—he redefines what leadership and identity look like on campus."
